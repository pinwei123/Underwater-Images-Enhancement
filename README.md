# Underwater Images Enhancement

Enhancing underwater images to restore natural color, improve visibility, and recover details often lost due to light absorption and scattering in underwater environments.

---

## Project Overview

Underwater images often suffer from:

* Color distortion (especially loss of red channel)
* Low contrast
* Noise and hazy appearance
* Detail degradation

This project provides a lightweight enhancement workflow to improve the visual quality of underwater images.
